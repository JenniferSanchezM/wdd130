      <h2>I live in San Francisco De Macoris</h2>
      <img src="images/sfm.jpg" alt="San Francisco De Macoris">
      <P>San Francisco de Macor√≠s has some beautiful colonial buildings and a nice plaza, besides several mansions that were built by the returned emigrants that amassed their fortunes in the USA.</p>  
      <p>This town is also very interesting for those who love baseball, since it is one of the cities that has one of the country‚Äôs six baseball teams, the Giants.
      <p>In this beautiful city, located in the Cibao Valley, you can visit the magnificent Palace City Hall, where the local government of San Francisco de Macor√≠s is housed. Other symbolic places in this town are Santa Ana Cathedral, a building that mixes modern and gothic architecture, and the ‚ÄúMontecito de Getseman√≠‚Äù, a precious space devoted to prayer. It is also interesting to take a walk in both Los M√°rtires park and Duarte park, just opposite the city hall.</p>
