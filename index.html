      <P>San Francisco de Macorís has some beautiful colonial buildings and a nice plaza, besides several mansions that were built by the returned emigrants that amassed their fortunes in the USA.</p>  
      <p>This town is also very interesting for those who love baseball, since it is one of the cities that has one of the country’s six baseball teams, the Giants.
      <p>In this beautiful city, located in the Cibao Valley, you can visit the magnificent Palace City Hall, where the local government of San Francisco de Macorís is housed. Other symbolic places in this town are Santa Ana Cathedral, a building that mixes modern and gothic architecture, and the “Montecito de Getsemaní”, a precious space devoted to prayer. It is also interesting to take a walk in both Los Mártires park and Duarte park, just opposite the city hall.</p>
